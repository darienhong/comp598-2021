The counting problem can come from the way that we have annotated the data. We are looking for the fraction of tweets that contain the word "Trump" in it, but this can lead to a miscount because the tweets which contain "Melania Trump" are also counted, which may not be what we want. Since the word "Trump" is used in different contexts, it may not give us the accurate representation we need. Another thing to consider is that for troll-bot farms, often they'll post duplicate tweets across multiple accounts within minutes of each other. For example, we can see that in dataset.tsv the tweets with tweetID 914336862730375170 (row 11) and 914338590313902080 (row 12) are exactly the same, but were published just minutes apart. This inconsistency leads to artificially inflated number of Trump counts or non-Trump counts, and our counting system doesn't account for that.
